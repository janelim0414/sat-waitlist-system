## SAT Wailist System

If you are a high school student preparing for SAT, you probably have experienced the struggles of finding a test center near your town.
This python script monitors the available test centers upto 100 miles from your zip code and notifies via email if any update is detected.
Inspired by Resy's waitlist system, I created a solution via web scraper that queries collegeboard's API endpoint to retrieve information about test centers.

Minimize your travel time, maximize your sleep, and ace your test!
