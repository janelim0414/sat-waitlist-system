## SAT Test Center Notification System

As a high school student preparing for the SAT, you might have faced the challenge of finding a nearby test center with available seats. This Python script helps alleviate that stress by monitoring test centers within a 100-mile radius of your zip code. Whenever a new test center with available seats is detected, the script sends you an email notification.

Inspired by Resy's waitlist system, this solution uses a web scraper to query the College Board's API and gather real-time information about test center availability. This way, you can minimize travel time, get a good night's sleep, and perform your best on test day!
